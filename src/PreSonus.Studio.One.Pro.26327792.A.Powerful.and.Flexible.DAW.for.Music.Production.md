## Vocoder and De-Esser
 
Studio One Pro 2.6.3.27792 includes two new native plug-ins: Vocoder and De-Esser. Vocoder is a classic effect that allows you to create robotic or harmonized vocals by modulating one signal with another, such as a voice and a synthesizer. You can choose from 16 different vocoder modes, adjust the carrier and modulator levels, and apply filters and effects to shape your sound. De-Esser is a useful tool that reduces sibilance and harshness in vocal recordings by attenuating specific frequency ranges. You can adjust the threshold, ratio, frequency, and width of the de-essing process, and use the listen mode to monitor the affected signal.
 
## Show Page
 
Studio One Pro 2.6.3.27792 introduces a new Show Page that lets you perform live with your recorded assets or stream your performance online. The Show Page allows you to create setlists with songs that contain backing tracks, virtual instruments, effects, and more. You can also assign scenes to each song that let you switch between different sounds or configurations with a single click or a MIDI command. The Show Page also integrates with PreSonus' hardware controllers, such as the StudioLive Series III mixers and the FaderPort Series control surfaces, for hands-on control of your live show.
 
## Customization Editor
 
Studio One Pro 2.6.3.27792 gives you more control over your user interface with the new Customization Editor. You can create custom layouts that show or hide different tools and functions according to your workflow preferences. You can also save and recall your customizations for different tasks, such as recording, mixing, mastering, or composing. The Customization Editor lets you personalize your Studio One experience and optimize your productivity.

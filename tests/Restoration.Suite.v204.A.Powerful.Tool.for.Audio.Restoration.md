The suite includes:
 
- **DeNoise 2:** A plugin that reduces stationary noise such as hiss, fan noise, wind noise, and buzz. It features a new adaptive mode that automatically adjusts the noise reduction parameters to the changing noise floor.
- **DeHum 2:** A plugin that removes low-frequency hum and rumble caused by ground loops, power lines, or faulty wiring. It features a new fine-tune mode that allows you to adjust the notch filters for more precise hum removal.
- **DeClick 2:** A plugin that removes impulsive noise such as clicks, pops, crackles, and vinyl scratches. It features a new multi-band mode that allows you to process different frequency ranges separately for more effective declicking.
- **DeClip 2:** A plugin that restores clipped audio by reconstructing the peaks that were lost due to overloading or clipping. It features a new oversampling mode that improves the quality and accuracy of the declipping process.
